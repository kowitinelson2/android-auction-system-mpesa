It is an standalone Android application that uses the  Android SDK , Ormlite to provide its an Auction System. 
The application uses Navigation Drawer pattern to provide an easy navigation flow. The application uses Fragment based 
approach to give the feeling of a single page application and a very smooth transition between screens. Ormlite is used to build 
an extensive application backend.

The main idea is to allow users to submit Auction items on which other app users can bid. Every auction item has a bidding period. The landing 
screen of the app is basically a auctioning feed for all the items available for bidding. User can pick item from that feed and submit its bid.
Bid with highest amount becomes the winner after the bidding closes. There are other options for user to view auctions submitted by him/her, 
option to view the Auctions won by user and the related seller details. User can view all the bids on an auction item submitted by user along with
bid details and username of bidder.
